## Building Photo Journaling As a Way for Effective Habit And Task Tracking.

I'm an independent developer, and I'm thrilled to introduce Folksable, an elegantly designed habit and task tracker app with social photo check-ins.

**My Small Story:** In late 2022, I was determined to improve my life by forming new habits. I had a list of personal goals, including learning to swim and making evening walks a habit for reflection. However, I quickly realized the lack of support and motivation in existing habit-tracking apps. Most lacked the social features needed for habit formation.

As a developer, I decided to create a solution, one that not only tracks your progress but also enhances your experience through social engagement. To make Folksable, I delved into habit research, listened to countless podcasts, and pored over popular books on the topic, reimagining the world of habit-building.

## What Sets Folksable Apart From Other Habit Tracking Apps

* **Social Contracts**
    * by declaring a new habit you form a social contract, which makes you want to be consistent with that identity of yourself in your social group.
* **Photo Check-ins**
    * Other apps let you tick a box to mark it as done, we let you share a photo progress of your habit with your friends, and they cheer you up, also it forms a cute photo journal of you evolving in that habit.
    * optionally you can also share the music you are listening to by giving the app notification area access, so it will automatically add what you are listening to from many music players that support music controls in the notification area, audiobooks, etc, and more while you do your check-in.
* **Precise Scheduling**
    * Other apps let you create a habit with schedules like x times a week, and y times a month, but not exactly when we made a thoughtful decision to go with precise scheduling, I’ll explain why.
* **Delightful User Experience**
    * Forming a new habit is already hard enough, if you are not having fun and delight while using the app, it brings friction between you and your habits, making you not want to open the app and eventually quit the habit.
    * The app has an elegant design, you will feel a sense of calmness and zen, the delightful interactions make you look forward to the day and want to come and check in and make progress
* **Ad-Free Experience**
    * This comes back to the earlier point about reducing the friction between you and your habits, forming a new habit is like rubbing sticks together to get fire, starting is the hardest and we want you to have a great distraction-free experience.
    
* **Event Calendar**
    * you can click on “You have X events today“ or navigate from your profile to the event calendar.
    * because we use precise scheduling we know exactly what events you have for any given day based on your rituals and todos, and you can prepare in advance for them and see what your day looks like.
* **Quick Check-in Access**
    * **At a Glance**:
        * precise scheduling allows us to show all the events you have on a day, on that day, in a mini*player*like UI that we call “**At a Glance**” in the dynamic bottom bar that adapts according to the screen you are on, it features your day progress indicator based on time of day, and the distribution of events of that day represented as dots based on their scheduled time.
    * At a Glance features events of your day in a Horizontal-Swipe Interface, for each event you can quickly check-in by clicking on Plus ⊕, or Skip them by clicking on the Skip button next to the check-in button.
    * Events will be available to check in all day, and your check-in time will allow us to show stats based on your Check-in time offset from the scheduled time.
    * This reduces the friction between you and your habits, having quick check-in access right on the bottom bar from anywhere on the app, just a tap away, makes you want to check in and complete the day's progress.
* **Granular Privacy Controls**
    * For each Ritual and Task, you can choose its Privacy level, independently of others
        * Private only you can see that ritual or task, and your check-in will be private.
        * Friends you and your friends can see that ritual or task and their respective check-in
        * Public Everyone can view that ritual or task and their respective check-in.
* **Collaborative Rituals**
    * you can invite your friends to join your ritual or join theirs as a member, all members will have the same schedule adjusted to their timezone.
    * Leaderboards of members based on the number of Check-ins make it fun and have someone along the ride (best for your gym buddies).
    * Global rankings of your collaborated rituals based on **topics** (Coming soon).
    
* **Ritual Goals** (coming soon)
    * It’s okay to miss your ritual events, and rarely does anyone expect a 100% completion rate, so we are adding a feature called ritual goals.
    * for each ritual you will be able to add a custom goal e.g., if your ritual is “Read” you can define a custom measure by giving it a unit like “a number of pages” and select if higher is better or lower is better.
    * after you add a custom measure for each check-in you will be asked to add a measure for that day in this case “10 pages” etc.
    * This allows us to give more insights and stats and lets you understand different dimensions of your progress.
    
* **Backlog Insights** (Coming soon)
    * When you miss a check*in for a ritual, the next day it lets you select a reason from a list of reasons that you can customize for each ritual
    * This lets you understand what’s the most frequent reasons why you skip your events.

* **Detailed Stats** (Coming soon)
    * Because we have precise scheduling, it allows us to give you insightful stats that go beyond just check-in graphs.
    * Stats based on Check-ins with respect to their day of the week
    * Stats based on Check-ins with respect to their week of the month
    * Stats based on Check-ins with respect to their month of the year
    * Stats based on Time Offset with respect to their Scheduled time.
    * Calendar visualization of check-ins as a heat map.
    * and more valuable insights…
